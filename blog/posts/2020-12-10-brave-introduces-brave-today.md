# Brave Introduces Brave Today, the Privacy-Preserving News Reader Integrated Into the Browser

Brave Software announced a new privacy-preserving content stream seamlessly
integrated into the browser called Brave Today. The Brave Today news reader is
accessible below the new tab page and is delivered anonymously to the user’s
browser via Brave’s new private content delivery network (CDN). When users
scroll down to fetch the feed on a new tab page they will discover links to
content published by major media outlets in 15 different categories, including
global news, business and finance, sports, fashion, food, lifestyle, tech and
crypto news, and they can easily customize their stream. Brave Today is
available via the Brave browser on both iOS and desktop devices.

The Brave Today news reader ranks stories locally for the user from hundreds of
popular RSS feeds using an [algorithm](https://brave.com/brave-today-content)
that weighs several factors, including the user’s browser history and article
published date. This stream is designed to help people discover interesting new
content throughout the day while respecting the user’s privacy.
